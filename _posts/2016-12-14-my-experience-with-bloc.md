title: My Experience with Bloc
---

I was sure I wanted to become a web developer, but I wasn’t sure about Bloc. So I took the biggest step towards commitment just shy of paying for the service and signed up for their email list. I was glad to get that career move off of my to do list. I spent the next few months looking up online guides and courses, making some decent progress here and there. But I wasn’t moving as fast as I thought I should be. Sometimes the curriculum would change suddenly or there were huge gaps in what I was supposed to know in order to succeed. Most importantly, there was no guidance. That’s what did it for me.


During all those months I was chugging away “at my own pace,” I was getting reminders that Bloc provided the guidance I wanted. Eventually, I signed up. And I’m glad I did. Bloc has been a good experience overall. The most important thing that I’ve learned has been where I need to improve. I had no idea what a job interview was going to be like. It turns out that I’m not good at solving problems out loud or recalling definitions and debugging code with a pen and paper. I probably would have discovered this eventually. But I’m glad it wasn’t during my first job interview or casually searching “nailing the interview” on my phone. It’s integrated into the curriculum and during the live one-on-one sessions with your mentor. 


My mentor also stressed the need for efficient code and clean code. Both of those things were never a problem during self study, except that feeling of jealousy and awe I’d get when seeing an especially elegant solutions to a problem that took me five times the code to solve. I didn’t need to be elegant and I didn’t need to make my code understandable to anyone else. That won’t fly in the real world. So for much of my time at Bloc, I’ve been trying to break some bad habits I’ve developed.


Another issue was that I found myself searching for the documentation on basic methods, just to make sure I got it right. I had done this throughout my self study period, because I had no reason not to. Of course, during a job interview, it might look weird to get tripped up on elementary features of a language, and my mentor recommended that I learn some of this stuff by heart. And then there’s the added speed bump this caused my problem solving. My brain was spitting out inelegant solutions because I had only the most rudimentary features on hand. Becoming familiar with the rest would open up different approaches to solving problems. Sometimes this would even eliminate large chunks of code and replace it with one method.


The curriculum itself is a mix of step-by-step guides and projects. I found much of this useful and I did like how the guides will be more explicit early on and then gradually taper off later. Sometimes, this was a bit frustrating, but in the end I think it helped me. The more I used the concepts, the more comfortable I got.


I haven’t finished Bloc yet, but I’m excited to finish it and get on with the next step in my career. If things keep going well, I’ll soon be writing about Bloc as a success story.
